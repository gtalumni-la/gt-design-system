Update typography tokens to match official GT brand guidelines

- Change secondary font family from Source Sans Pro to Roboto per GT brand guidelines
- Update font fallbacks with modern system fonts for better cross-platform support
- Improve comments to reference GT brand guidelines and font family relationships
- All button components now use Roboto for body text as intended by GT branding

This change aligns the design system with official Georgia Tech typography standards while maintaining backward compatibility.
